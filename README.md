# Project-2-SocialNetwork-ECommerceModels
A project of predicting the influence of connections in a social network and finding the most influential friends for the benefit of advertising for the purchase of a product

# Project 2 Electronic Commerce Models

- Chose to share this project as an example, to reflect my thought process and coding abilities with regards to:

	- Prediction algorithms
	- Research a Network Science


## Files uploaded

- Data: 1 zipped file. 
	- project_2_data: 4 csv files (spotifly.csv, instaglam_1.csv, instaglam0.csv, ID1_ID2.csv)

- Electronic Commerce Models Project 1 - Assignment.pdf
- Code & Explanations.pdf
- Code.py
- Results.csv (The influencers chosen for each of the artists)

## How to review

- Extract all data from zipped files
- I recommend starting from reading the project assignment overview guidlines, to understand the project and the data (Electronic Commerce Models Project 1 - Assignment.pdf)
- Second, look into the Code & Explanations.pdf to understand the steps and the thinking process.
- Third, The results we have selected for each of the artists matching our ID numbers can be seen in the results file.
- Last, run Code.py (use a random number, in our case we were asked to enter the identification numbers of the partners, to choose the artists).

## No code needed review (if you dont want to run any code files or extract zipped data)
